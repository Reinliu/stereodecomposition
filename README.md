# Stereo Decomposition

The Stereo Decomposition is a project I've worked on with decompositing stereo sound files into direct and ambient tracks. I followed the methods introduced by Christof Faller JAES, 54(11), 2006
in his paper Multiple Loudspeaker Playback of Stereo Signals. 

THe project uses entirely Matlab. The functions that are required for the model were uploaded.

Please download the entire project as a folder and open with the Stereo Decomposition Matlab file.
